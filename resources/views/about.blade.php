                    <b>It all began with an assignment.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <p style="padding-left:20px;">The four founding Hurrivivalists were all enrolled in the same internet programming course at
                    the University of North Florida. Shortly after hurricane Irma ravaged the entire state of
                    Florida, an idea was formed when they were given an assignement to create a website. What
                    started as a simple school project has blossemed into the region's premier hurricane survival
                    supplier. Their vision to bring you quality supplies at rock-bottom prices became their passion.
                    Today, our inventory includes the finest generators, air conditioners, and most delicious
                        survival food on the market.</p>
